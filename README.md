# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Gradio

This repository contains a handwritten digit recognition system using TensorFlow and Gradio. The pre-trained model predicts handwritten digits drawn on a canvas. The TensorFlow model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. Gradio provides a user-friendly interface for drawing digits and getting real-time predictions.

## Features

- Draw digits on the canvas
- Get real-time predictions
- Experience the model's inference capabilities interactively
